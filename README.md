In this Homework I have built the best model to predict wine quality from its characteristics so that the winery can replace the costly services of professionals.

The data for this exercise comes from the wine industry. Each record represents a sample of a specific wine product, the input attributes include its organoleptic characteristics, and the output denotes the quality class of each wine: {high, low}. The labels have been assigned by human wine-tasting experts, and we can treat that information as “ground truth” in this exercise.
